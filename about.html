    <h1>Who is MK</h1>
    <p>In real life I am just an ordinary person. I live in a small town, got a job, a family and that would be all if not for the internet. Computers have been my hobby since I got my first one, a ZX Spectrum back in the distant 80s. Lately I took up programming as a hobby (although I would love to become a professional developer). So here I am trying to make a somewhat meaningful page for my project.</p>
    <p>Professionally I have almost nothing to do with computer programs (of course almost every job requires more or less extensive use of computers. If you really want to know I studied Agricultural Science in uni and I've got an MSc in Biotechnology.</p>
